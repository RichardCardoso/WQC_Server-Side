Version: 2.5.0.0
Date: 2019/05/27
A) Functional changes:
-It's not possible to set a 'project' as fished. Instead, every report has it's own finish state. 
--For 'Kontrolkarte' report, it can only be set as finished when there are no more 'not checked' items
---If the client name has not been set yet, the client will be prompted to inform it. If this data is not provided then the report state will not change.
--For Check/Mark reports, they can only be set as finished when there is at least one mark on it
--Changing a report to a 'finished' state blocks the same report for future changes (unless it's set back to unfinished state)
--Reports preview at the browser interface will now get an updated version of the report, even if it's not finished
-It is now possible to assign multiple roles to a single device. Upon marks making, a 'primary' role should be selected (at the mark creation screen) to be assigned to the new mark
-Drawing's 'time-lock' feature was replaced by 'Spring JPA optmistic locking'.
B) Structure changes
-Changed ORM framework from 'pure' hibernate to Spring JPA

-Changed controller's methods in order to have generic methods (one for each operation and reusable for all entities - devices, roles, etc)
-Changed rest methods endpoints naming strategy
-Database settings on the server should now be set at a file named 'database.properties'. After any changes to this file, tomcat must be restarted in order to apply the changes
-Code lines ammount was substantially reduced (both for server and app) due to the generic methods creation, enpoints naming strategy change and DomainEntity concept application.
